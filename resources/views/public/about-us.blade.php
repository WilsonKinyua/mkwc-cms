                is located in Nanyuki, at the foot of the scenic
                Mount Kenya forest ecosystem, a UN World Heritage
                Site, and an important and rich biodiverse area. It
                is home to 28 different animal species, a population
                of roughly 1,200 different animals. The
                Conservancy&#39;s three main programmes include a
                breeding and rewilding project for the critically
                endangered Mountain Bongo antelope, an animal
